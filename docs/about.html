            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their capabilities beyond traditional text-based tasks to multimodal domains, integrating visual, auditory, and textual data. While multimodal LLMs have been extensively explored for high-level planning in domains like robotics and games, their potential as low-level controllers remains largely untapped. In this paper we introduce a novel benchmark aimed at testing the emergent capabilities of multimodal LLMs as low-level policies in Atari games. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods that require training for each new environment and reward function specification, these LLMs utilize pre-existing multimodal knowledge to directly engage with game environments. Our study assesses multiple multimodal LLMs performance against traditional RL agents, human players, and random agents, focusing on their ability to understand and interact with complex visual scenes and formulate strategic responses. Our results show that these multimodal LLMs are not yet capable of being zero-shot low-level policies, further, we see that this is, in part, due to their visual and spatial reasoning. </p>
